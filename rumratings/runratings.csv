United States,"Inspired by Australian PGA Hall of Fame Golf Legend Jan Stephenson; whose winning spirit won her 3 majors and 16 LPGA titles, paving the way for all women in pro sports! Jan’s Pineapple Flavored Rum is made from Turbinado sugar and molasses, fermented and distilled, then brought to proof with condensed Pineapple  juice and the most important ingredient — artesian, limestone-filtered water. This water is sourced directly from the majestic mountains of Utah, home of the greatest snow on earth! The snowmelt then flows into the distillery's own Artesian Well creating the unique flavor profile crafted from this mineral rich water.  This handcrafted rum has a murky golden amber color. Fruity, spicy aromas and flavors of dried mango, allspice, nutmeg, and fine caramels with a satiny, crisp, fruity medium body and a warming, involved, long finish that exhibits notes of fresh mango, sweet ripe pineapple, spiced honey, and leather finish. A true-to-life pineapple rum that competes with the best of ’em; sip, shoot, or make a stellar pineapple daiquiri. ",Dented Brick Jan’s Pineapple Flavored Rum,0,0.0,Flavored

United States,"Antelope Island Red is made from dehydrated green sugarcane juice from Lula Farm in Louisiana and a touch of molasses from the same source, brought to proof with the most important ingredient — artesian, limestone-filtered water. This water is sourced directly from the majestic mountains of Utah, home of the greatest snow on earth. This snowmelt then flows into the distillery's own Artesian Well creating the unique flavor profile crafted from this mineral rich water.  Premium rum aged in Cabernet wine barrels makes Antelope Island Red unique. Aging in wine barrels creates compelling aromas and flavors of cola candies, cinnamon red hots, marzipan, spumoni, and caramel syrup with a lean, soft, fruity light body and a hot, short finish that presents shades of root beer float and wood shavings finish. A serviceable rum for mixed drinks. ",Dented Brick Antelope Island Red Rum,2,10.0,Aged

United States,"Antelope Island Rum ingredient is made from dehydrated green sugarcane juice from Lula Farm in Louisiana and a touch of molasses from the same source, brought to proof with the most important — artesian, limestone-filtered water. This water is sourced directly from the majestic mountains of Utah, home of the greatest snow on earth! The snowmelt then flows into the distillery's own Artesian Well creating the unique flavor profile crafted from this mineral rich water.  This award-winning white rum has compelling notes of guava Himalayan salt, vanilla, lime, and pineapple. Toasty aromas and flavors of candy corn, dark honey roasted nuts and stalks, latte, and hint of paint with a satiny, vibrant, dry-yet-fruity light-to-medium body and a peppery, intriguing, long finish with notes of vanilla cream, sweet and peppery spices and minerals and wet straw finish. A nice, spicy and warming white rum that will pop in cocktails. ",Dented Brick Antelope Island Rum,2,9.0,Light
